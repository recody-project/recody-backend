In its nascent days, \\\"pop\\\" applied to commercially successful artists who won broad public interest with lighthearted fare. As the 20th century progressed, popular music gravitated to a particular sound: three minutes of bright melodies & infectious hooks. Today, pop music continues to swerve back and forth between these two aspects of its definition. Because the term essentially refers to music composed for popular appeal, the aesthetics of pop vary almost constantly according to the tastes of the time: doo-wop, disco and electronic dance music have all been pop. At the same time, artists in very un-mainstream genres (like indie rock and electronic music) often play or at least play with that quintessential pop style of bright melodies and infectious hooks.

Even so, most would probably agree that rap describes a type of music while hip-hop refers to a cultural phenomenon that includes graffiti, breakdancing, and fashion in addition to music -- or as rapper turned social theorist <a href=\\\"http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/krs-one\\\">KRS-One</a> says, \\\"Rap is something you do, hip-hop is something you live.\\\" <p><p>Musically, the only difference between the two is that rap always contains the vocal element of rhythmically spoken rhymes while hip-hop can be purely instrumental in nature. Rap in its earliest stages consisted of DJs mixing records and juggling beats and breaks for block parties while emcees rhymed over the rhythms. This practice of adapting, dissecting, and transforming pre-recorded music to create new songs could be hip-hop's most significant contribution to modern music. <p><p>Today, the digital sampling techniques first used by hip-hop producers to expand on the looping capabilities of live DJs are commonly used in electronica as well as mainstream rock music. In terms of industry presence, hip-hop made its biggest splash with Gangsta Rap, which gathered steam in the late '80s and dominated the pop charts in the '90s. Mainstream music, dazzled by this sudden sales power, devoured rap and spawned myriad rap/R&B crossovers and even heavy metal hybrids. In the midst of all this success, the DJ community responsible for pioneering hip-hop music faded from the popular picture, replaced by advanced samplers and elaborate studio production. Consequently, the rise of the turntablist movement celebrated DJs as musicians in their own right, not just in the context of rap groups. The return of the DJ heralded a resurgence of live energy in rap and hip-hop music.\",\n" + "            \"links\": {\n" + "                \"childGenres\": {\n" + "                    \"ids\": [\n" + "                        \"g.1027\",\n" + "                        \"g.16\",\n" + "                        \"g.38\",\n" + "                        \"g.448\",\n" + "                        \"g.173\",\n" + "                        \"g.174\",\n" + "                        \"g.175\",\n" + "                        \"g.249\",\n" + "                        \"g.250\",\n" + "                        \"g.309\",\n" + "                        \"g.365\"\n" + "                    ],\n" + "                    \"href\": \"https://api.napster.com/v2.2/genres/g.1027,g.16,g.38,g.448,g.173,g.174,g.175,g.249,g.250,g.309,g.365\"\n" + "                },\n" + "                \"parentGenres\": {\n" + "                    \"ids\": [\n" + "                        \"g.2200\",\n" + "                        \"g.10001\"\n" + "                    ],\n" + "                    \"href\": \"https://api.napster.com/v2.2/genres/g.2200,g.10001\"\n" + "                }\n" + "            }\n" + "        },\n" + "        {\n" + "            \"type\": \"genre\",\n" + "            \"id\": \"g.194\",\n" + "            \"name\": \"Soul/R&B\",\n" + "            \"href\": \"https://api.napster.com/v2.2/genres/g.194\",\n" + "            \"shortcut\": \"soul-r-and-b\",\n" + "            \"description\": \"Soul and R&B encompasses much of non-sacred African American music.

For our purposes, let's define it as traditional music from the British Isles to colonial America. Over time it mingled with traditional sounds from Africa, France and even Germany. It also crossed paths with parlour music, a 19th-century form of pop music. By the mid-20th century America was home to a number of folk traditions, including Cajun music, country blues, gospel and bluegrass. Nearly all this stuff was and is made by and for working-class rural types using a combination of voice, guitar, percussion, banjo and other stringed instruments. All this, of course, changed after the folk revival and folk-rock explosion of the 1960s. Nowadays, folk music is as much a general mindset transcending class, color and geography as it is a set of identifiable genres.\",\n" + "            \"links\": {\n" + "                \"childGenres\": {\n" + "                    \"ids\": [\n" + "                        \"g.116\",\n" + "                        \"g.117\",\n" + "                        \"g.118\",\n" + "                        \"g.147\",\n" + "                        \"g.148\",\n" + "                        \"g.150\",\n" + "                        \"g.151\",\n" + "                        \"g.206\",\n" + "                        \"g.207\",\n" + "                        \"g.297\",\n" + "                        \"g.350\",\n" + "                        \"g.381\",\n" + "                        \"g.400\",\n" + "                        \"g.478\",\n" + "                        \"g.486\",\n" + "                        \"g.489\"\n" + "                    ],\n" + "                    \"href\": \"https://api.napster.com/v2.2/genres/g.116,g.117,g.118,g.147,g.148,g.150,g.151,g.206,g.207,g.297,g.350,g.381,g.400,g.478,g.486,g.489\"\n" + "                },\n" + "                \"parentGenres\": {\n" + "                    \"ids\": [\n" + "                        \"g.2200\",\n" + "                        \"g.10001\"\n" + "                    ],\n" + "                    \"href\": \"https://api.napster.com/v2.2/genres/g.2200,g.10001\"\n" + "                }\n" + "            }\n" + "        },\n" + "        {\n" + "            \"type\": \"genre\",\n" + "            \"id\": \"g.69\",\n" + "            \"name\": \"Vocal/Easy Listening\",\n" + "            \"href\": \"https://api.napster.com/v2.2/genres/g.69\",\n" + "            \"shortcut\": \"vocal-easy-listening\",\n" + "            \"description\": \"Vocal, refers to popular music that places the spotlight squarely on the human voice.
